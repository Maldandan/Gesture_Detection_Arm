# Gesture_Detection_Arm
This project allows you to control an Arduino robotic arm using hand gestures detected by a YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model. The system captures real-time video from a webcam, processes it using YOLO to identify hand gestures, and sends corresponding commands to the Arduino to perform actions with the robotic arm.
